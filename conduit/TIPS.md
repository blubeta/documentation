### Tips 
- You will generally be working on one module at a time, so when working on a module, it is recommended to open your Code Editor to that specific module directory.
- If you have any questions regarding the issue, ask Dave Whiteside.
- If you have any questions regarding implementation or bugs, ask Henry Williams.
- I generally use an UI to look at their DBs and data structure. It makes it a lot easier to understand their data structure, and import schemas. My choice was DBBeaver.
