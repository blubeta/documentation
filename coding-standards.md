# blubeta Coding Standards
This is a live list of coding standards that we use on an every day basis.  Everyone is encouraged to make their contributions to make onboarding for new members and vendors an easier endeavor.

## CSS
- [Airbnb css style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/css/blob/master/README.md)
- Styling should always use `flex`
- DO NOT USE `float` (use `flex`)
- DO NOT USE `px` (responsiveness across the board) `em,vm,vh`

## JS
- [JS Standard style guide](https://standardjs.com/rules.html)

## PHP
TBD

## RUBY
- [RuboCop ruby style guide](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/ruby-style-guide)

## GIT

- Commits should be written in active tense.
  ex: Updates Readme.md

- History should be linear which can be maintained by merging upstream and rebasing downstream
  ex: rebase Master onto Develop and merge Develop into Master (in that order...)
