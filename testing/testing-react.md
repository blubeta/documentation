## Testing React

### Unit & Integration Tests

* [Jest - Testing Platform](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
* [Enzyme - Testing Utility](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/)

Jest is the testing framework we'll use to test all JavaScript. This means we can use Jest to test React, Express, Vanilla JS, etc.

Enzyme provides a jQuery-like API for selecting and traversing the output of our React Components. We'll only use Enzyme with React.
